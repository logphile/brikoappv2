OPERATING CONTRACT (Windsurf)
- Always take the first unchecked task under "Queue" in AGENT_TASKS.md.
- Work on a branch: ws/<slug>. Open a PR immediately, label it `automerge`.
- Keep commits small; let CI/E2E/Lighthouse run. Do not push to main directly.
- On success & merge: move the item to "Done" with a one-line summary + PR link.
- If blocked (secrets/permissions), convert PR to Draft and open an Issue labeled `windsorfollowup` describing the blocker.
