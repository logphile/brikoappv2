# PDF Templates

Place the high-resolution cover image for Build Guide v2 here as `cover-v2.png` (300dpi recommended).

Expected path at runtime:

- `/pdf-templates/cover-v2.png`

Notes:
- The PDF generator uses a full-bleed addImage of this asset for page 1.
- If the asset is missing, the generator will still build the rest of the guide, but the cover page will be blank.
